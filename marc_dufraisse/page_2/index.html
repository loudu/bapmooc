    John von Neumann (1903-1957) was a Hungarian-born American mathematician. He mades major contributions to a number of fields including mathematics, quantum mechanics, game theory and computer science.

In 1944, he joined the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) team at the University of Pennsylvania. It was the world’s first electronic general purpose calculator made of more than 17,000 vacuum tubes, designed by John Eckert (1919-1995) and John Mauchly (1907-1980). However, it was difficult to program so they soon started to work on a new simpler and more powerful machine called EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer).

                <p class="ligne col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-justify titilium">    Von Neumann formalized its principles and wrote a First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC in June 1945. The key feature was that data and programs were both stored in the same memory.

Herman Goldstine (1913-2004), co-developer of ENIAC, distributed the memo with von Neumann as the sole author. This paper whose public distribution nullified patent claims, was well received and became to this day the basis of modern computer design.

Due to von Neuman's prominence as a major American mathematician, the stored program architecture became known as the von Neumann architecture

                Alan Turing (1912-1954), was a British mathematician who was a leading participant in the breaking of German codes during the Second World War. He is widely considered to be the father of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.

From 1945 to 1947, he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory in London. He presented a paper on February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer. Von Neumann's incomplete report had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed.

                 <p class="ligne col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 text-justify titilium">    Turing was highly influential in the development of Computer Science, giving in 1936 a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing Machine.

A Turing Machine is a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite its apparent simplicity, by explaining the logic of any computer algorithm, it is considered as the first formal model of a general purpose computer.

He also addressed the problem of artificial intelligence and proposed an experiment which became known as the Turing Test. The idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.
